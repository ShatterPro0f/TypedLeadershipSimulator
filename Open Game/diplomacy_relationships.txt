Diplomacy and Relationships Rules

1. Diplomatic Score
------------------
DOS = alpha * P_t + beta * R_f + gamma * M_s + delta * T_c
- P_t = player negotiation tone
- R_f = relation with foreign leader
- M_s = mood of NPC/advisor
- T_c = resource leverage/threats

2. Relationship Adjustments
---------------------------
Delta R = DOS - Threshold
Updates faction alignment and trust over time

3. Interaction Rules
-------------------
- Soft diplomacy: cultural exchange, festivals, marriage alliances, aid
- Hard diplomacy: threats, embargoes, ultimatums, espionage, military posturing
- Leaders have personality, history, bias
