Open-World Typed Leadership Simulator - Game Design Document

Title:
[Working Title] – Open-World Typed Leadership Simulator

1. Game Overview
----------------
Genre: Open-world, first-person, emergent simulation, text-driven leadership
Core Concept: Players start as the leader of a small settlement, growing it into a thriving society entirely through typed decisions. NPCs, advisors, factions, and societies respond dynamically. Player influence is indirect.

Key Features:
- 3D open-world exploration
- Typed input only; no menu selections
- NPCs, advisors, factions react dynamically
- Emergent simulation with cultural, religious, political, and factional systems
- Deterministic outcomes; LLM provides narrative flavor
- Multi-stage events and cascading consequences

2. Core Gameplay Loop
--------------------
1. Issue Presentation: NPCs/advisors/factions present problems, context, and suggestions.
2. Player Input: Freeform typed decisions.
3. LLM Interpretation: Converts text into simulation instructions and narrative flavor.
4. Simulation Execution: Updates NPCs, advisors, factions, resources, culture, religion.
5. Narrative Feedback: Descriptive consequences of decisions.
6. Context / History Update: Tracks unresolved issues, states, and evolution.
7. Emergent Follow-Up: New problems/events arise; loop continues.

3. Core Systems
---------------
- NPC Emotional Model
- Advisors and Influence
- Factions
- Culture
- Religion
- Diplomacy
- Security & Defense
- Knowledge & Technology
- Typed Decision System

4. Emergent Gameplay
-------------------
- Cascading events, multi-stage crises, long-term consequences
- NPC/advisor/faction memory of player style
- Cultural and religious evolution influenced by player leadership

5. Player Experience Goals
-------------------------
- Freedom: creative typed input
- Immersion: realistic NPC/faction reactions
- Emergence: independent evolution of culture, religion, factions
- Strategy: balance resources, advisors, diplomacy, factions, culture
- Role-Playing: leadership style affects world evolution

6. Interface Design
------------------
- Message Window: Incoming issues with tone, context, suggested solutions
- Player Input Field: Multi-line typed responses
- Context / History Panel: Tracks unresolved issues, states, culture/religion, resources
- Outcome Feed: Narrative feedback
- Optional Visual Cues: Urgency, faction tension, advisor emphasis, resource changes

7. Narrative & World Building
-----------------------------
- Dynamic world starting from a small settlement
- NPCs with backstories, motivations, and faction affiliations
- Emergent stories driven by decisions, faction politics, religion, diplomacy
- LLM provides narrative flavor; simulation provides deterministic outcomes

8. Conceptual Diagrams
----------------------
- Typed-Decision Loop Flowchart: Issue Presentation → Player Input → LLM Interpretation → Simulation Execution → Narrative Feedback → Context Update → Emergent Follow-Up

9. Potential Expansion / DLC Ideas
----------------------------------
- New regions, cultures, factions
- Random environmental events: floods, droughts, plagues
- Unique advisors with story arcs
- Advanced diplomacy with neighboring kingdoms
- Secret societies, espionage, political intrigue

10. Key Enhancements

- Tone memory for NPC/faction reactions
- Ambiguity consequences for vague input
- Optional suggested solutions
- Emergent multi-stage events
- World awareness summaries for situational briefings

11. Player Experience Flow
--------------------------
1. Read issue in message window
2. Type response
3. LLM interprets intent, tone, style
4. Simulation executes consequences
5. Narrative feedback displayed
6. Context/history updates
7. Emergent follow-ups appear → loop repeats
